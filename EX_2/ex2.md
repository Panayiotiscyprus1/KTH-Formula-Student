## About This Script

This Python script creates an **interactive plot** of a mathematical function using Matplotlib. It allows you to dynamically adjust the range of the plot using a **slider**.

## What It Does

1. Plots the function:  
   \( h(t) = 3\pi e^{-5 \sin(2\pi t)} \)
2. Displays a **slider** at the bottom of the plot that lets you change the value of \( t \).  
   - As you move the slider, the plot updates instantly to show the new range.
